You are creating a study scaffold (NOT complete notes) for exam preparation.

Subject: {subject}
Subtopic: {title} - {description}
Exam format: {exam_format}
Student must be able to: {must_be_able_to}

Source material (read carefully):
{concatenated_pages}

Generate a Markdown scaffold with:

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of what this subtopic covers]

## Key Concepts to Master
[Bullet list of main ideas with BLANKS to fill, e.g., "**______** is the process by which..."]

## Definitions (Fill These In)
- **Term 1**: ____________
- **Term 2**: ____________

## Important Distinctions
[Comparison table or bullets highlighting confusions, e.g., "X vs Y"]

## Example to Reproduce
[Prompt for student to work through an example, with hints about where to find it]

## Likely Exam Questions
[3-5 questions based on exam format, each citing source page]

## Sources to Read
[Table: PDF | Pages | Why Read]
Make sure to include links to specific PDFs using the format:
[PDF_name](pdf/path) | p.X-Y | Reason to read
The pdf path should be `../../subjects/{subject}/sources/<PDF_name>`.


Rules:
- Use blanks (____) not complete answers
- Cite page numbers in square brackets [PDF_name p.X]
- Keep scaffolding—student must fill gaps from sources
- Format for easy scanning (headers, bullets, tables)
