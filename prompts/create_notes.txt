## Exam Focus
Based on the \`{exam_format}\` style, describe the most probable question type or angle for this topic.
*   *Example:* "Expect to explain the trade-off between X and Y" or "Be ready to derive formula Z."
*   *Action:* Provide 1 concrete example question (with a very brief answer summary).
