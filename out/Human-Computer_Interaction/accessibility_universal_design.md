# Universal Usability & Accessibility: Revision Notes

## Essence of the Topic (The "Why")

**Accessibility** concerns the match between a user's abilities and a system's required abilities, ensuring people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital products equally. **Universal usability** extends this further—it aims to make products usable and accessible by all people, regardless of their abilities, age, literacy, culture, or other characteristics. Both are critical in HCI because they recognize that designing for diverse users improves systems for everyone (the "curb-cut argument").

## Key Concepts & Critical Vocabulary

- **Accessibility**: The usability of a product by people with the widest range of capabilities; focuses specifically on people with disabilities and the match between user abilities and system requirements.

- **Universal Usability**: Design of information and communications products usable by all citizens; Ben Shneiderman defines it as having more than 90% of all households as successful users of services at least once weekly.

- **Inclusive Design**: A process-oriented design method ensuring products are usable by a very wide spectrum of users; uses specific methods and toolkits (e.g., inclusive design toolkit) and requires accurate statistics on user population characteristics.

- **Ability-Based Design**: A design stance tailored specifically to end-users' needs and abilities; requires deep understanding of target groups and often involves co-design with representative users.

- **Universal Design** (or "Design for All"): Broader concept defined as "the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design."

## Core Mechanism / Logical Flow

### Three Main Strands of Accessibility Research in HCI

1. **Increasing access to digital tools** by offering users new forms of technology
2. **Understanding users' needs, preferences, and abilities** through research and co-design
3. **Increasing access to the physical world** through design considerations

### Key Design Approaches

1. Adopt ability-based design tailored to target users' specific needs
2. Involve representative users early and throughout the design process (co-design)
3. Obtain accurate statistics on user population characteristics
4. Sample representative individuals and user groups proportionally
5. Apply inclusive design methods and toolkits to accommodate a wide range of abilities

## Critical Distinctions

| Concept                 | Focus                                                                                 | Scope                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accessibility**       | People with disabilities; match between user abilities and system requirements        | Specific to disability-related barriers                           |
| **Usability**           | Effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction for general users; user experience design | General user experience (may not address disability needs)        |
| **Universal Usability** | All citizens; successful use across 90%+ of households                                | Broadest scope; includes age, literacy, culture, economic factors |
| **Inclusive Design**    | Very wide spectrum of users; process-oriented with toolkits                           | Systematic, measurable approach using design parameters           |

**Critical insight**: Accessibility differs from usability because usability concerns the relationship between users, tools, and tasks, while accessibility concerns whether a system can be used by people with the widest range of capabilities. Many accessibility requirements improve usability for everyone, especially in limiting situations (e.g., captions benefit people in noisy environments).

## Disability Categories in HCI Research

A comprehensive HCI accessibility literature survey identified nine communities:

1. Blind or low-vision
2. Deaf or hard of hearing
3. Autism
4. Intellectual or developmental disability
5. Motor or physical impairment
6. Cognitive impairment
7. Older adults
8. General disability or accessibility
9. Other

**Key challenge**: Each user manifests disabilities at different degrees and in different combinations; solutions for one community may not work for others. Users may have multiple disabilities, requiring stricter design requirements.

## Reasons for Designing Accessible Systems

1. **Ethical imperative**: It is the right thing to do
2. **Scale of impact**: Over one billion people have some form of disability (WHO)
3. **Legal requirement**: Many jurisdictions mandate accessibility (e.g., ADA, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act)
4. **Universal benefit**: Accessibility improvements benefit all users (universal design/design for all)

## Practical Example: Speech-Generating Devices (SGDs)

SGDs illustrate ability-based design principles:

- **Symbol/picture-based interfaces** for illiterate AAC users (augmentative and alternative communication)
- **Text entry with prediction tools** for literate AAC users to increase entry rate
- **Single-switch interfaces** (e.g., eyebrow switches) using scanning keyboards for users unable to use physical keyboards
- **Eye-tracking systems** (eye-typing) for users with no effective interaction means beyond eye control

**Design challenge**: Single-switch systems are cumbersome and error-prone; word prediction and optimized scanning patterns help mitigate low entry rates and false activation issues.

## Exam Focus

**Probable question types:**

1. **Multiple-choice**: Distinguish between accessibility, usability, and universal usability; identify disability categories; recognize design approaches (ability-based vs. inclusive design)

2. **Essay questions** (likely 6-point format):
   - Explain the relationship between accessibility and usability, and why both matter in HCI
   - Describe the "curb-cut argument" and how it justifies universal design
   - Analyze a design scenario (e.g., vending machine for users with neurological challenges, sight limitations, or mobility impairments) and propose five design considerations per group
   - Compare ability-based design and inclusive design as approaches to accessibility

**Example question (essay):**
*"Explain why accessibility differs from usability. Use the curb-cut argument to illustrate how accessibility improvements benefit all users. Then, describe two design approaches (ability-based design and inclusive design) and explain when each is most appropriate."*

**Brief answer summary**: Accessibility focuses on the match between user abilities and system requirements (especially for people with disabilities), while usability concerns general effectiveness and satisfaction. The curb-cut argument shows that ramps benefit wheelchair users, parents with strollers, and delivery workers—demonstrating universal benefit. Ability-based design tailors solutions to specific user groups through co-design; inclusive design uses systematic toolkits and population statistics to accommodate a broad spectrum of users.
