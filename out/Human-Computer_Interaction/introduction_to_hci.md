## Essence of the Topic (The "Why")
**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** is a discipline concerned with the **design, evaluation, and implementation** of interactive computing systems for human use, studying major phenomena surrounding them. It emerged in the late 1970s with personal computers to ensure computing supports people productively, enjoyably, and safely, addressing human complexity, computer sophistication, and design challenges.

## Key Concepts & Critical Vocabulary
- **`User Interface`**: Part of a computing system users see and control to provide input, receive feedback, and interact without managing underlying hardware/software.
- **`HCI Definition`**: Discipline for designing/evaluating/implementing interactive systems for human use and studying surrounding phenomena (ACM, 1992).
- **`Research Problems`**: **Empirical** (data-grounded phenomena), **conceptual** (theories/models), **constructive** (building systems).
- **`HCI Practice Activities`**: User understanding (research), design/prototyping, evaluation (usability testing), stakeholder engagement.
- **`Core Question`**: How can people with different goals/capabilities/contexts use computing productively, enjoyably, safely?

## Core Mechanism / Logical Flow
HCI combines science, design, engineering via interconnected research-practice cycle:
1. **Empirical research** identifies interaction phenomena (e.g., user learning).
2. **Conceptual research** explains via theories/models.
3. **Constructive research** builds/improves systems.
4. **Practice** applies via user research, design, evaluation, collaboration.
5. Cycle repeats, linking data to knowledge to design.

## Critical Distinctions
**HCI vs. Other Fields**: HCI centers humans (needs/abilities) in design/evaluation, unlike computer science (computation-focused) or pure design (aesthetics-focused); it integrates psychology, sociology, etc., for sociotechnical context.

## Exam Focus
Expect MCQs on HCI definition/history/challenges and essays analyzing why HCI is multidisciplinary or practitioner activities.  
**Example**: "Define HCI per ACM and list its 3 research problem types (3 pts)." *Answer: ACM: design/eval/impl of interactive systems for humans + phenomena study; types: empirical (data), conceptual (theory), constructive (building).*
